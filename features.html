      <h2>Core Features and Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        HR-NotiWave offers an array of features tailored to enhance the
        experience of every user within a company. One of the standout features
        is the intelligent chatbot, designed to assist candidates by providing
        valuable information about the company and guiding them through the
        application process. This feature alone sets HR-NotiWave apart from its
        competitors, offering a personalized touch that many other HR
        applications lack.
      </p>
      <p>
        For job seekers, HR-NotiWave provides the ability to request to join a
        company of their choice. Employers, in turn, have the power to accept
        these requests based on their specific requirements and standards. This
        dynamic interaction not only simplifies the recruitment process but also
        ensures that companies attract the right talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key feature is the self-attendance marking system, which allows
        employees to easily record their attendance. This system is complemented
        by the leave application feature, enabling employees to request leave
        while allowing employers to evaluate and approve these requests based on
        the validity of the reasons provided. This comprehensive approach to
        attendance and leave management reduces administrative burdens and
        enhances transparency within the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teamwork and collaboration are critical components of any successful
        company, and HR-NotiWave addresses this need with an integrated
        communication system. By facilitating seamless communication within the
        application, HR-NotiWave eliminates the need for external communication
        tools, streamlining workflows and fostering a more connected workplace.
